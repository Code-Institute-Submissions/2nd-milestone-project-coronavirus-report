# Coronavirus Report
## Code Institute: Milestone Project 2

Coronavirus Report is a website that aims to inform people about COVID-19 globally cases, displaying 
the information in a clear and simple way. In addition to follow the coronavirus worldwide cases, you 
can also review the information for each country and using historical data, Coronavirus Report is able 
to predict future cases of COVID-19 with 2 weeks in advance, due to the use of machine learning technology.

The idea for this project was born from the current situation the world is going through because of this virus, 
which still has no vaccine and has meant a complete change in the way we live our daily lives.

## UX

### Main aims

- To Provide a platform for users to review information about this new coronavirus, and check the situation both globally and in their respective countries.
- To make the website interactive through the use of JavaScript, using different libraries and APIs available to create a great user experience.
- To make it easy for users to make their way through each feature on the website, by having a clear menu bar. 
- To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes.

### Ideal user

#### The ideal user for this website is:

- English speaking, due the website language.
- Who ideally has a good internet connection.

#### Visitors to this website are searching for:

- Information related to the COVID-19, due to the fact that it is a new disease that is affecting the whole world, and is at the moment of greatest concern worldwide. 

#### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

- This is a great platform to display the information required by users, because it allows you to interact with the data available about this new coronavirus.
- There are similar platforms, but these do not allow users to interact much with the information, instead Coronavirus Report allows you to choose the range of dates to consult 
  the data of your interest, and then these are presented in different charts.
- Coronavirus Report does something that other platforms do not have, and the reason is that it is able to predict future cases in any country through the use of 
  machine learning technology.
- This website also has a small section with summary information about the coronavirus.
